      <h1>What This Blog Is</h1>
      <p>Hi, it's Binh and welcome to my blog.</p>
      <p>With this, I'll try my best to share everything I know about the world in short posts and mini functions. Like this:</p>

      <p>What's the sum of two numbers?</p>
      <SumOfInts />

      <p>.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>.</p>

      <p>Did you think the answer's wrong? Well, let me explain.</p>
      
      <p>In the question above, I write "sum of two numbers", but I didn't specify numbers of what?</p>
      
      <p>In terms of mathematics, "1 plus 1 is 2", which might transfer to "I have 1 apple, someone give me an another one, so I must have 2 apples".</p>

      <p>Sounds right, but it's a simplifying way to think about the world and I think it's perfectly normal to teach children like this, however, it's actually much more complicated.</p>
      
      <p>If I have an apple and someone give me an another one, I might just eat one, or sell it, or make apple juice, ... Even if I don't do anything, the apples might just get deformed over a period of time.</p>

      <p>So, the answer is really depends on what objects are we counting, how's the environment effecting them and over how long?</p>

      <p>...Yeah, this isn't gonna be useful though.</p>

      <p>If you're asking which audience I'm targeting, I'd just say myself (in the past or future) because I don't think anyone would benefit from all of my posts.</p>

      <p>With that said, if you're not me and wanting to explore any post I made, feel free to do so.</p>
